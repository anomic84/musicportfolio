                    Spencer Carlson is a Singer-Songwriter based out of Seattle Washington. Lyrically mused by desire, depression and anxiety, while finding hope and relief, he sings over a bed of carefully chosen chords or arpeggiated progressions. He combines the feel of influences like Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, and Thurston Moore into songs that sound original and unique.
